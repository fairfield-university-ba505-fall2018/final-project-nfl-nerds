**Motivation**
- For our project, we choose to analyze playoff baseball statistics. 
- We wanted to analyze these patterns to find trends that may explain certain phenomena in baseball today.
- Along with this, we were interested in forecasting certain statistics that we found interesting in today's game.

**Research Questions**
- Is there a specific formula to winning the world series?
- Over the years, has the game of baseball changed like many analysts have claimed?
- What can we expect next season in regards to certain statistics?

**Data Source**
- We collected our data from the API on www.baseball-reference.com, which is a large statistical database for major league baseball statistics.

**Challenges**
- HTML code was too difficult for us to parse. We ended up converting the data into csv files, which we were much more familiar with.
- Filtering data for specific world series winners was a challenge because we needed to filter by two columns (year and team name). This was a code that we as a group have not dealt with yet.
- Finding a predictive model that would work and was not too complex was extremely challenging.
    - We attempted to use a linear regression model, but we were not able to understand how to apply it correctly in python.
    - Using knowledge from a previous class was helpful in identifying a model we could more easily apply.
    
**Lessons Learned**
- Over the years, in the 21st century, baseball has changed from a well rounded offensive mind set to much more of an all or nothing approach.
- In general, hits have decreased over the years in the playoffs which affects batting average and on base percentage. Strikeouts have drastically increased, showing less of a concern for getting on base and more of an emphasis on driving in runs through home runs.
